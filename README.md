# React.js Animation Project

This project demonstrates my React.js skills along with proficiency in using JavaScript animation frameworks (GSAP or Anime.js) to create interactive and visually engaging animations.

## Task Overview

This project includes a set of animations designed to evaluate my ability to implement smooth transitions, creative effects, and well-structured code in React.js. The task involved implementing the following animations:

1. **Globe Animation**: A continuously rotating globe with smooth rotation.
2. **Colorful Music Notes**: Animated colorful music notes flowing inside the globe.
3. **Golden Music Note Hover Effect**: An interactive hover effect for a golden music note (scale, rotate, or glow).
4. **Mobile Screen Animation**: A slight tilt or vibration effect synchronized with the golden music note.
5. **"UNLOCKING VALUE" Text Animation**: A horizontal slider with smooth scrolling for the "UNLOCKING VALUE" text.
6. **Laptop Screen Animation**: A subtle "breathe" effect where laptop screens grow and shrink in a loop.
7. **Text Transitions**: Fade-in effects for text elements.
8. **Lion Paws Animation**: Lion paws moving left to right as a loading effect.
9. **Trusted By Logos Slider**: A logo slider with hover effects.

## Libraries Used

- **React.js**: Framework for building the user interface.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Library used for creating the animations, particularly for smooth transitions and effects.
- **Anime.js**: An alternative animation library, used for certain animations to ensure diversity in animation techniques.
